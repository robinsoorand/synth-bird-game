## How to Get This Game on Your Phone

You can play this game on your phone like a real app! The easiest way is to host the code online for free and then add it to your phone's home screen.

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1.  **Sign up or Log in:** Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a free account or log in if you already have one.
2.  **Create a New Repository:**
    *   Click the **+** icon in the top-right corner and select **"New repository"**.
    *   Name your repository something simple, like `flappy-bird-game`.
    *   Make sure it's set to **Public**.
    *   You can skip adding a README, .gitignore, or license for now.
    *   Click **"Create repository"**.

### Step 2: Upload the Game Files

1.  **Go to Your New Repository:** You'll be on the main page of the repository you just created.
2.  **Upload Files:**
    *   Click the **"Add file"** button and choose **"Upload files"**.
    *   Drag all the game files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `manifest.json`, `sw.js`, `icon.svg`, and this `README.md`) into the upload box.
    *   Scroll down and click **"Commit changes"**.

### Step 3: Host the Game with GitHub Pages

GitHub provides a free service called GitHub Pages to host websites directly from your repository.

1.  **Go to Settings:** In your repository, click the **"Settings"** tab near the top right.
2.  **Select Pages:** In the left sidebar, click on **"Pages"**.
3.  **Configure the Source:**
    *   Under "Branch", make sure it says `main`.
    *   Click the **"Save"** button.
4.  **Get Your Game URL:** After a minute or two, refresh the page. You will see a green box at the top saying "Your site is live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`".
    *   **This is the public URL for your game!** Copy it.

### Step 4: Add the Game to Your Phone's Home Screen

Now, you can "install" the game on your phone.

#### For iOS (iPhone/iPad):

1.  Open the **Safari** browser (this only works in Safari).
2.  Navigate to the game URL you just copied.
3.  Tap the **Share** button (it looks like a square with an arrow pointing up).
4.  Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**.
5.  You can rename the app if you want, then tap **"Add"**.
6.  The game's icon will now be on your home screen, and it will launch like a regular app!

#### For Android:

1.  Open the **Chrome** browser.
2.  Navigate to the game URL you just copied.
3.  Tap the **three-dot menu** icon in the top right.
4.  Tap **"Install app"** (or "Add to Home screen").
5.  Follow the on-screen prompts.
6.  The game's icon will appear on your home screen or in your app drawer, ready to play offline!

That's it! You now have a fully functional game on your phone. Enjoy!
